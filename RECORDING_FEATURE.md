## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Frontend Environment
```bash
# API Base URL
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Installation & Setup

### Backend Dependencies
```bash
npm install openai ffmpeg-static fluent-ffmpeg form-data
```

### Frontend Dependencies
```bash
# Material-UI components already included
# No additional dependencies required
```

### FFmpeg Setup
The application uses `ffmpeg-static` for audio processing. This is automatically installed with the backend dependencies.

## Usage Guide
